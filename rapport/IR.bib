  abstract = {This paper presents a recognition system, which improves human-computer interaction. In this paper, we’ve designed a face recognition system and hand gesture recognition system to perform different tasks. We’ve implemented detection and recognition using Haar-cascade classifiers and LBPH recognizers in the face recognition system. Our hand gesture recognition system detects the gesture and maps it with different tasks like launching applications such as notepads, paint, and opening websites. Gesture recognition is performed using a convex hull. Both the systems have been implemented with the help of OpenCV. Our results show that HCI can be improved with minimum hardware requirements.},

  abstract  = {This paper describes a machine learning approach for visual object detection which is capable of processing images extremely rapidly and achieving high detection rates. This work is distinguished by three key contributions. The ﬁrst is the introduction of a new image representation called the “Integral Image” which allows the features used by our detector to be computed very quickly. The second is a learning algorithm, based on AdaBoost, which selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efﬁcient classiﬁers[6]. The third contribution is a method for combining increasingly more complex classiﬁers in a “cascade” which allows background regions of the image to be quickly discarded while spending more computation on promising object-like regions. The cascade can be viewed as an object speciﬁc focus-of-attention mechanism which unlike previous approaches provides statistical guarantees that discarded regions are unlikely to contain the object of interest. In the domain of face detection the system yields detection rates comparable to the best previous systems. Used in real-time applications, the detector runs at 15 frames per second without resorting to image differencing or skin color detection.},
