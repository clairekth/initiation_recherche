  abstract = {This paper presents a recognition system, which improves human-computer interaction. In this paper, we’ve designed a face recognition system and hand gesture recognition system to perform different tasks. We’ve implemented detection and recognition using Haar-cascade classifiers and LBPH recognizers in the face recognition system. Our hand gesture recognition system detects the gesture and maps it with different tasks like launching applications such as notepads, paint, and opening websites. Gesture recognition is performed using a convex hull. Both the systems have been implemented with the help of OpenCV. Our results show that HCI can be improved with minimum hardware requirements.},
